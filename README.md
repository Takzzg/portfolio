# About this project

This is a personal web portfolio I've developed in my free time to host my side projects and make them accesible to other people. I'm currently planing on having the following sections:

-   Home page[^1]
-   Ant Colony Optimization[^1]
-   Conway's Game of Life[^1]
-   Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization[^1]
-   Sorting Algorithms Visualization[^2]

## Ant Colony & Conway's Game of Life

This sections will host an interactive canvas in wich you can play around with these two famous simulations

-   [Ant colony Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) (also known as ACO) is a Swarm Intelligence technique inspired by the ability of real ant colonies to efficiently organize the foraging behavior of the colony using chemical pheromone trails as a means of communication between the ants, in order to find the optimal path from the nest to the food source, and back.

-   [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a well known cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It really doesn't need any more introduction...

## Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization

This section will host an interactive canvas in wich you'll be able to place and move the start position, end position, checkpoints and obstacles around in a grid, to then be solved by one of the following pathfinding algorithms:

-   [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
-   [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
-   [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
-   [A\* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

## Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This section will host a non-interactive canvas wich will display an adjustable array of bars to then be sorted by one of the following algorithms:

-   [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
-   [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)[^1]
-   [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)[^1]
-   [Quixksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)[^1]
-   [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)[^1]
-   [Bucket Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort)[^1]
-   [Shell Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort)[^1]
-   [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)[^1]

# This project was created using:

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
-   [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

## Run on your local machine

First, Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Lastly, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser to see the result.
